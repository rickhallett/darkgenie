# Claude Code is Programmable

This repository demonstrates how to use Claude Code programmatically, showcasing examples in different programming languages. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/2TIXl2rlA6Q) to understand why this is so important for next generation engineering. Check out the [voice to Claude Code](https://youtu.be/LvkZuY7rJOM) video to see how to use the `voice_to_claude_code.py` script.

## Quick Start

First off - run these right away to understand how important this is:

```bash
# Claude Code example (with only Write and Edit tools allowed)
claude -p "make a hello.js script that prints hello" --allowedTools "Write" "Edit"

# Aider equivalent example
aider --message "make a hello.js script that prints hello" hello.js
```

Here's the big trick - with Claude Code, you can call ANY TOOL IN ANY ORDER IN NATURAL LANGUAGE.

Check out the other examples in the repo to understand how to scale your impact with this feature.

Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/2TIXl2rlA6Q) to internalize how important this is for next generation engineering. View the brief anthropic documentation [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/tutorials#use-claude-as-a-unix-style-utility) and a more comprehensive write up on [agentic coding here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices). The Claude Code team is doing incredible work.

You can also use [Aider](https://aider.chat/) as a programmable ai coding tool to do similar things although it's strictly limited to AI Coding (which is still incredibly useful). Check out the documentation [here](https://aider.chat/docs/scripting.html).

## Setup

### Configuration Files

1. **MCP (Multi-call Protocol) Configuration**
   - Copy the sample configuration file to create your own:
     ```bash
     cp .mcp.sample.json .mcp.json
     ```
   - Edit `.mcp.json` to add your Notion API key in the `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS` section:
     ```json
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "notionApi": {
           "command": "npx",
           "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
           "env": {
             "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": "{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_NOTION_API_KEY\", \"Notion-Version\": \"2022-06-28\" }"
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Copy the sample environment file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.sample .env
     ```
   - Add the following API keys to your `.env` file:
     ```
     NOTION_INTERNAL_INTEGRATION_SECRET=your_notion_integration_secret
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
   - Note: The voice_to_claude_code.py script specifically requires both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to be set.
   - The anthropic_search.py script requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to be set.

## Anthropic Web Search Tool
> See the [anthropic_search.py](anthropic_search.py) file for more details.

A command-line utility for searching the web using Anthropic's Claude AI with their web search tool capability.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- UV package manager (`pip install uv`)
- Anthropic API key

### Setup

Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x anthropic_search.py
```

### Usage

Basic search:
```
./anthropic_search.py "your search query"
```

With domain filtering (only include results from these domains):
```
./anthropic_search.py "javascript best practices" --domains "developer.mozilla.org,javascript.info"
```

Block specific domains:
```
./anthropic_search.py "climate change" --blocked "unreliablesource.com,fakenews.org"
```

With location context:
```
./anthropic_search.py "local restaurants" --location "US,California,San Francisco" --timezone "America/Los_Angeles"
```

Increase maximum searches:
```
./anthropic_search.py "complex research topic" --max-uses 5
```

Use a different Claude model:
```
./anthropic_search.py "your query" --model "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"
```

### Output

The script produces:
1. The search query used
2. Claude's response with inline citations marked as [1], [2], etc.
3. A list of sources at the end, numbered to match the citations
4. Usage information showing how many web searches were performed

### Notes

- Web search is available on Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku
- Each search counts as one use, regardless of the number of results returned
- Searches cost $10 per 1,000 searches, plus standard token costs for search-generated content
- Domain filtering doesn't need https:// prefixes and automatically includes subdomains
